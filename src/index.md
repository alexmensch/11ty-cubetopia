[This entire sentence is a link.](https://www.google.com/) Only the word [monkey](https://www.yahoo.com/) is a link in this sentence.

The word **strong** has strong emphasis in this sentence. The word _italics_ is, well, you guessed it, italicized in this sentence. **_Strong italics_** has both styles applied, which is honestly a bit _much_.

This is an unordered list of items:

- Banana
- Coconut
  - Rum

  - Rice
  - Spicy sausage
  - Protein
    - Alligator

This is an ordered list of items:

1. Download Node.js

4. Celebrate!

> This is something that someone _else_ said, not I. They continue with their quote here

```python
import banana
# There is an extra space at the start of the first line...why?
from library import module as monkey

def hello_world():
  printf("%s", monkey.say_hello())
