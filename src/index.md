intro:
  main: "Fluid, responsive styling on any device without nasty breakpoints"
  summary: |
    Cubetopia is designed to be visually appealing and readable with any content, on any device, out of the box. Both type and space scale automatically, and the layout of every component adjusts naturally to the available space. This showcase site demonstrates the styling and the layouts that are available. You're encouraged to preview it on different devices to get a feel for how the fluid type and space adjust automatically. Check out the project on [Github](https://github.com/alexmensch/11ty-cubetopia).
highlights:
  - title: Opinionated defaults
    body: The default styling is opinionated but grounded in timeless design principles. Branding and styling can be easily changed via configuration, and the built in layout blocks can be combined in ways unique to your needs.
  - title: Looks great on any device
    body: It's impossible to know what size device or viewport a user will view your site in, which is why Cubetopia is built so that you never have to worry about it. Every layout block, space, and even the typograhy fluidly resizes and reconfigures gracefully to ensure that the site is always readable and stylish.
  - title: Focus on your content
    body: Because all the hard work of building the layouts is done for you, all you need to do is focus on adding content to the site. User-friendly, readable design and typography are important to keep visitors engaged, but do not need to be reinvented every time.
features:
  - title: Fluid type
    body: Type that fluidly adjusts to any device and viewport size.
  - title: Fluid space scaling
    body: Spacing that adjusts in harmony with type.
