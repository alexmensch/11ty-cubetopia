  main: "Fluid, responsive styling on any device without nasty breakpoints"
  summary: |
    Cubetopia is designed to be visually appealing and readable with any content, on any device, out of the box. Both type and space scale automatically, and the layout of every component adjusts naturally to the available space. This showcase site demonstrates the styling and the layouts that are available. You're encouraged to preview it on different devices to get a feel for how the fluid type and space adjust automatically. Check out the project on <a href="https://github.com/alexmensch/11ty-cubetopia">Github</a>.
